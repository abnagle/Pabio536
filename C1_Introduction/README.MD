# Class One: Intro to Pabio536

This class will start with an overview and introductions, how to work with github, and some basics of working with Anaconda including firing up Jupyter notebooks. 

My current thought is to use the introductory [walkthroughs provided by Github](https://guides.github.com/), in particular the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) page.

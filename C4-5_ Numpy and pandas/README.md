# Classes 4 & 5: Using numpy and pandas in python to store and manipulate data

For this class we will intruduce the students to two important python libraries. Panel data, or `pandas`, are convenient way of storing and sorting data within python. We will also show students how to use `numpy` to transform and process the data. I'm planning on modifying the Jupyter notebook found [here](https://github.com/trustad/python-intro-to-numpy).

# Pabio536: Bioinformatics, Gene Sequence Analysis and Beyond
University of Washington
Pathobiology 536
*Taught by David Sherman, Shuyi Ma, and Tige Rustad
With guest lectures by Andrew Gustin, Fred Mast, Bart Staker, and Sandhya Subramanian [Add TAs, guest lecturers, etc]*

The goal of this class is to introduce students to a set of bioinformatic tools to further their future research. The first section of the class we will introduce the basics of Github, python, and some of the python libraries that are for data handling, analysis, and presentation.  We will then focus on tools for analyzing sequence data, with an emphasis on RNAseq analysis. The data will be used in the next section, where we will cover various ways of describing data using networks. The last classes will cover bioinformatic approaches to dealing with the added complexity of proteins. We will wrap up the class with a self guided project, where students use the tools from this class to solve a *reasonable* problem of interest to them or their lab. 

This repository will hold Jupyter notebooks for some classes, small datasets for practice, and some homework assignments.
